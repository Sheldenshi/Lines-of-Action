<h1> Lines of Action </h1>

<p> 
  Lines of Action (LOA) is a board game invented by Claude Soucie.
</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>
  * Black moves first
  <br>
  <br> * Each turn, the player to move moves one of his pieces, in a straight line, exactly as many squares as there are pieces of either color anywhere along the line of movement. (These are the Lines of Action).
  <br>
  <br> * You may jump over your own pieces.
  <br>
  <br> * You may not jump over your opponents pieces, but you can capture them by landing on them.
  <br>
</p>

<h2>Controlling Play</h2>

<p>
  Make a move by clicking the square that you want to move first then the position that you want to move it to.
